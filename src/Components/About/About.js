							<h2 className='my-4 display-4'>My Background</h2> As a kid I
							had an immense fascination with computers, games, and how they
							work. At the age of 11 I found the site{" "}
							<a href='http://www.angelfire.com'>angelfire.com</a>. As where
							most youth's have diaries or some way to express themselves I
							found this was my perfect space and asI shaped this site and
							wanted to customize it more and more I learned how to use their
							"Advanced" editor (HTML). I spent literally years researching and growing my
							knowledge on the power of HTML. Even showing off my site at a Show
							& Tell in my middle school class which astounded my teachers. This showed me
							what I wanted to be when I "grew up".

							<h2 className='my-4 display-4'>Becoming an engineer</h2> I spent
							years working for a company doing side work for their websites but
							holding different titles and basically working as a junior DBA. My last employer took me in, trained me
							in HTML5, CSS3 & Twitter Bootstrap Design and I designed and implemented those designs for
							<a href='https://www.koons.com/'> Koons Automall</a>,{" "}
							<a href='https://www.hersonsauto.com/'>Hersons Automall</a>,
							<a href='https://www.toyotacarlsbad.com'> Toyota Carlsbad</a> and{" "}
							<a href='http://www.autosavant.com/'>Autosavant</a> to name a few,
							but I had touched and worked on probably more than 60% of the
							Automobile Dealerships in America. These sites had alot of innerworking parts
							which peaked my interest on what actually goes on under the hood
							(API's, User Authentication, Javascript etc..). So I took
							some time to do my own research and go to school for Software
							Engineering. Now as a graduate of General Assembly, I feel i'm
							ready to take on the world, really hone and apply the amazing
							skills I have learned.
